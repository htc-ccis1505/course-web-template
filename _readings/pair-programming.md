# {{ page.title }}
In this course, we will be using a technique called pair programming. Pair programming is the practice of writing computer programs in pairs, with one partner (the "driver") actively controlling the computer and the other (the "navigator") observing. As the driver writes the program, the observer helps plan and catch errors.

An important feature of pair programming is that the partners switch roles frequently. This ensures that each partner has a good understanding of all parts of the program, and that the person in each role remains focused. As you progress through labs, we will suggest places for you and your partner to switch roles.
